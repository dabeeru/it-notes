- fix corresponds to patch
- when \! or BREAKING CHANGE header is used then it corresponds to Major

### Other

- You can use some automatic tools to process the commit messages
    - Generate changelog
    - Bump versions automatically 
- If single commit contains changes for both types it should be really multiple commits.
- if errors are madeÂ  fix them with interactive rebase if not merged yet, if already merge then fuck it.
